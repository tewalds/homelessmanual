 "The fact is that with cooperative systems, a single person can now contribute to solve a problem, without having to move into a professional
relationship with an institution. This is a profound change in the ways human affairs are arranged." - Clay Shriky

In 2009, the City of Edmonton mandated to end homelessness by 2029. Helping Manual: A guide for homeless and affordable housing is an independent private sector initiative built to facilitate access to relevant information, and collect the knowledge contributions of anyone who is willing to help end homelessness. It started when Anne Matthews, Reg Cheramy, Timo Ewalds and Sean Healy met over drinks to flush out the idea of using technology as a tool to leverage the efforts of countless case workers who are currently working on helping people who are in need of support, in a homeless or low-income situation. The idea was brought to life at a "Startup Weekend" event.

Startup Weekends are 54-hour events where developers, coders, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and create start-ups. Startup Weekends are weekend-long, hands-on experiments where entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs can find out if startup ideas are viable.  Most events have about 75 attendees, half of which have technical backgrounds and the other half have business backgrounds.
